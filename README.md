# FreeCodeCamp-Challenge | Intermediate Front End Development Project

# Show the Local Weather 

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.
